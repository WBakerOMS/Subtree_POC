# Subtree_POC
This repository is to test subtrees

## System Setup
The extensions C/C++ and CMake Tools will need to be added to VS Code.

I have pushed **my** CMakePresets file. This should work if you follow these [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) for getting the compiler. You will also have to download [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).
